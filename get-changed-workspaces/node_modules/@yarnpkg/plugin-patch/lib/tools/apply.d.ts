/**
 * How does noNewLineAtEndOfFile work?
 *
 * if you remove the newline from a file that had one without editing other bits:
 *
 *    it creates an insertion/removal pair where the insertion has \ No new line at end of file
 *
 * if you edit a file that didn't have a new line and don't add one:
 *
 *    both insertion and deletion have \ No new line at end of file
 *
 * if you edit a file that didn't have a new line and add one:
 *
 *    deletion has \ No new line at end of file
 *    but not insertion
 *
 * if you edit a file that had a new line and leave it in:
 *
 *    neither insetion nor deletion have the annoation
