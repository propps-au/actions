/**
 * Prior work:
 * - https://github.com/atlassian/yarn-deduplicate
 * - https://github.com/eps1lon/yarn-plugin-deduplicate
 *
 * Goals of the `dedupe` command:
 * - the deduplication algorithms shouldn't depend on semver; they should instead use the resolver `getSatisfying` system
 * - the deduplication should happen concurrently
 *
 * Note: We don't restore the install state because we already have everything we need inside the
 * lockfile. Because of this, we use `project.originalPackages` instead of `project.storedPackages`
 * (which also provides a safe-guard in case virtual descriptors ever make their way into the dedupe algorithm).
